# Elastic
## Glossary:
* **Index:** An index is like a table in a relational database. It has a mapping which contains a type, which contains the fields in the index. An index is a logical namespace which maps to one or more primary shards and can have zero or more replica shards.
--

* **Shards:** A shard is a single Lucene instance. It is a low-level “worker” unit which is managed automatically by Elasticsearch
  * This is where the data is stored
--

* **Document:** A document is a JSON document which is stored in Elasticsearch. It is like a row in a table in a relational database
--

* **Field:** A document contains a list of fields, or key-value pairs.
--

* **Mapping:** A mapping is like a schema definition in a relational database. Each index has a mapping, which defines a type, plus a number of index-wide settings. A mapping can either be defined explicitly, or it will be generated automatically when a document is indexed.
---
# Interracting with Elastic
* Interracting with Elastic is done via a web API.
* There are multiple pre-built clients for different languages to simplify use of the API, but they are wrappers to the actual API.
Example:
```Bash
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "name": "John Doe"
}
'
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/customer/_doc?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "name": "Jane Doe"
}
'
```
What is happening here?
--

* 2 new documents(record) are being inserted into the customer index(table).
* pretty means that the output is formatted nicely
---
```Bash
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/1/_update?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{
  "doc": { "name": "Jane Doe", "age": 20 }
}
'

```
What is happening here?
--

* Record #1 is being updated

---
```Bash
curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/2?pretty"
```
What is happening here?
--

* Record #2 is being deleted.
---
```Bash
curl -X POST "localhost:9200/customer/_doc/_bulk?pretty" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
{"update":{"_id":"1"}}
{"doc": { "name": "John Doe becomes Jane Doe" } }
{"delete":{"_id":"2"}}
'

```
What is happening here?
--

* record 1: name field updated
* record 2: deleted
---
```Bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -XPOST "localhost:9200/bank/_doc/_bulk?pretty&refresh" --data-binary "@accounts.json"
curl "localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v"
```
What is happening here?
--

* Bulk create records via file upload
* confirm that file uploaded successfully

# Searching for data in Elastic:
Lets go through this documentation / guide together.
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/_exploring_your_data.html
---
# Class Exercise:
Lets write a python script to index our salespeople data from earlier this week.

Some useful snipets:
```Python
# read data from a json file
import json
with open('data.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(data)
```
```Python
# write data to a text file
text_file = open("Output.txt", "w")
text_file.write("Purchase Amount: %s" % TotalAmount)
text_file.close()
```

## Glossary:
* Visualization: A chart / graphical representation of data
* Dashboard: A collection of charts

# Class Exercise:
Lets visualize the salespeople data

# Exercise:
* Write a python script to import sales data into elastic
* Create visualizations from Monday's class in Kibana
