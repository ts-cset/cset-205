# Report Generation

---
## Report Generation

* Generating Reports goes hand in hand with the data analysis pipeline that we already discussed.
* Can be considered part of the "automation / computation" step
* You could also just be asked to generate reports outside of the data analysis lifecycle.
---
## Common reports you may see:
* Sales Reports
* Efficiency Reports
* Time Tracking
* Sprint Burndown
* etc...

## Lets build a dashboard.
* I own a used car dealership.
* Team of 10 salespeople.
* Monthly sales data.

### Visualizations Needed:
* number of cars sold (number)
* total profit (number)(base price + accessories - taxes)
* sales person rankings (table)(sort by $$ sold, include # sold, revenue brought in, total commissions)
* car manufacturer rankings (chart) (# sold)
* top 10 cars sold (chart) (# of same make/model sold)
