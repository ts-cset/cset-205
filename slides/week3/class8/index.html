# Agenda

1. Integrating APIs

---
## Web Requests.
* we saw this yesterday a bit.
* 4 types of web requests used:
  * GET
  * POST
  * PUT
  * DELETE

### Looked at three possible ways to pull api data into a webpage.

* Mixed PHP/HTML Files
* PHP Web Framework (Slim)
* HTML / Javascript
---
## What do we do?
--

### Lets pull the best parts of all three to make one cohesive website.
---
## Wait, what?
* Yesterday you said that mixed PHP/HTML files are old and terrible for building websites.
* HTML / Javascript was just demoed as another possible way to build this.
* Slim was made out like the best possible option.

--

True, however by combining all three together we can have a complete package of a website.
---
## Combine all three methods?

--
We play to the strengths of each component.

* Slim is good at routing and making API requests
* PHP/HTML files are good at creating page markup
* Javascript is good at interactive interfaces

---
## New Branch (class8)!
* Check out "class8" branch of the repository.
* You will have some conflicts with yesterday's activity of building out the individual person page.
* run "git stash" to store your changes before checking out the brach.
* rerun "composer install" to get new dependencies.
Changes from yesterday:
Refactored slimClient significantly.
---
## What is different?
* new directories in slimClient
  * public
  * templates
* Moved rendering logic into templates directory.
* javascript code is in the 'public' directory.
---
## Expand our slimClient.
### PHP-View / PHPRenderer
* This allows us to split rendering logic out of our app.php file.
* improve readability and developer sanity.
---
## To The Codebase!

### src/app.php
```PHP
$app->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
  $responseRecords = makeApiRequest('people');
  $tableRows = "  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Occupation</th><th>Actions</th></tr>";
  foreach($responseRecords as $person) {
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "<tr>";
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "<td>".$person["name"]."</td><td>".$person["age"]."</td><td>".$person["occupation"]."</td>";
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "<td>
    <a href='http://localhost:8080/slimClient/people/".$person["id"]."' class='btn btn-primary'>View Details</a>
    <a href='http://localhost:8080/slimClient/people/".$person["id"]."/edit' class='btn btn-secondary'>Edit</a>
    <a data-id='".$person["id"]."' class='btn btn-danger deletebtn'>Delete</a>

    </td>";
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "</tr>";
  }

  $templateVariables = [
      "title" => "People",
      "tableRows" => $tableRows
  ];
  return $this->renderer->render($response, "/people.html", $templateVariables);
});
```

<h1><?php echo $title; ?> <a class="btn btn-info" href="http://localhost:8080/slimClient/people/add">Add Person</a></h1>
<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Occupation</th>
    <th>Actions</th>
  </tr>
  <?php echo $tableRows; ?>
</table>
```

## Exercises:
1. Create JS handler for delete person button.
2. Create People Edit Form in templates and js handler
3. Convert get person to use a template, rather than inline rendering.

### As you finish:
Tomorrow's Project: Start converting your lab api to use html templates.
