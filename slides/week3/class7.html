# Quiz 1: APIs
---

# Last Week in Review
* PHP
* Composer
* Slim
* Unit Testing
* Error Handling
---
# PHP
* powers most of the internet
* server side code used to build websites and apis.
---
# Composer
* package manager for PHP
* Similar to NPM.
* configured via json file.
---
# Slim
* PHP microframework used to build websites and apis.
* we used it in labs.
---
# Unit Testing
* unit: smallest part of testable code
* Allows you to know your code woks.
* need to account for edge cases
---
# Error Handling
* return sane error messages to users
* response code, human readable message
---
# New Business!

## Integrating APIs!

Great!  We now have an API! <br/>
Now What??? <br/>
--
**Now we use it!** <br/>

---
# What does this mean?<br/>

--

## Back to html development!

--
Sort of...

Mixed PHP and HTML Files!

* Custom PHP Client:  labs/virtualMachines/exampleClient
* http://localhost:8080/exampleClient/


## TO THE CODE!
---
# Benefits
* quick to build
* easy proof of concept / prototype app.


# Some drawbacks:
* Not as clear as to what is rendering logic and what is business logic.
* No clear separation of concerns.
* not testable.
* routing is by directory structure.
* highly custom, no formal defined structure.
---
# Slightly less custom!

--

## Slim to the rescue!
* Slim client: labs/virtualMachines/slimClient
* http://localhost:8080/slimClient

## TO THE CODE!
---
# Benefits:
* written in slim
* matches the API
* routing is handled via slim, rather than via file name.
* testable


# Some Drawbacks:
* more effort to build
* more complicated than straight php/html code.

# HTML & Javascript sollution
* HTML & JS : labs/virtualMachines/javascriptClient
* http://localhost:8080/javascriptClient

## TO THE CODE!
---
# Benefits:
* entierely frontend
* html/javascript should be more comfortable to some of you

# Some Drawbacks:

* now have two different platforms
* asynchronous
  * partial page load
---
# Today's Lab:
Create an individual person page in the slim client.

* look at exampleClient/person.php for inspiration
