# Agenda

1. Review of yesterday
2. Keynote Presentation
3. Lab Time

---
# Friday Lunch-n-Learn:
Automatic drink dispensing machine.

---
# Yesterday:
* Combined mixed php/html, slim and javascript into one project.
* Introduced Template Files
* Javascript to handle user interaction.
---
# PHP/HTML, Slim & Javascript
* Play to their strengths.
* rendering code: PHP/HTML
* routing code: slim
* user interaction: javascript
---
# updated route logic
```PHP
$app->get('/', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
  $responseRecords = makeApiRequest('people');
  $tableRows = "";
  foreach($responseRecords as $person) {
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "<tr>";
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "<td>".$person["name"]."</td><td>".$person["age"]."</td><td>".$person["occupation"]."</td>";
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "<td>
    <a href='http://localhost:8080/slimClient/people/".$person["id"]."' class='btn btn-primary'>View Details</a>
    <a href='http://localhost:8080/slimClient/people/".$person["id"]."/edit' class='btn btn-secondary'>Edit</a>
    <a data-id='".$person["id"]."' class='btn btn-danger deletebtn'>Delete</a>

    </td>";
    $tableRows = $tableRows . "</tr>";
  }

  $templateVariables = [
      "title" => "People",
      "tableRows" => $tableRows
  ];
  return $this->renderer->render($response, "/people.html", $templateVariables);
});
```

# Template File

<script src="public/script.js"></script>

<h1><?php echo $title; ?> <a class="btn btn-info" href="http://localhost:8080/slimClient/people/add">Add Person</a></h1>
<table class='table'>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>
    <th>Occupation</th>
    <th>Actions</th>
  </tr>
  <?php echo $tableRows; ?>

# Javascript User Interaction
```Javascript
("#peopleForm").submit(function(event) {
  var form = $(this);
  event.preventDefault();
  $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "http://localhost:8080/firstslim/people",
    data: form.serialize(), // serializes the form's elements.
    success: function(data) {
      window.location.replace("http://localhost:8080/slimClient");
    }
  });
});
```

# Lets take a step back from code heavy lifting.

* Today's lecture is not code focused.
* It is inspired by several conversations I have had with both students and working developers over the years.


Lets talk about learning and life as a programmer for a bit.

--

### Disclaimer: I am not a Psychologist, but I am a developer and have seen this first hand

---

# Always something new
* Each project brings unique requirements and problems.
* As a developer you are constantly learning new languages, frameworks, systems etc...
* each new language / framework is another tool in your toolbox.
* impossible to master everything you come across (And that is ok).

---

## That rapid innovation and learning is great, but what does that do to a developer's mindset?

--
* constantly feeling like a total beginner / noob.

--
* not sure where to start when presented with a problem
  * Personal note from me: I experience this all the time.
  * It is not uncommon to stare at the same code for quite a while, and then realize it is 20 minutes later and I don't actually have a plan of attack

--
* this does get better over time as you build familiarity and a level of comfort with a language / framework
* never truely goes away though
  * At least not for me.

# Keynote Speaker PyCon 2015
## Jacob Kaplan-Moss
* Talking about mediocracy and skill levels as a developer.
* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE
---
# Takeaways?  Thoughts?

--

* measuring skill for developers is hard.
* most people are average at what they do.

---
# In relation to that, "Imposter Syndrome"
**Imposter Syndrome:** The feeling that I don't know what I'm doing, and worried that the people around me will realize that.
* Fueled by self-doubt.
* Nothing makes sense, not comprehending new languages/systems.
* https://medium.com/blueprint/fighting-impostor-syndrome-as-a-cs-student-c43859062e1
  * quick read.  (5-10 minutes)

# Lab/Assignment
Create a web interface for your Slim API.
## Due: Thursday 13th
* Create a new branch on your git repository from the last lab.
## Requirements:
### Pages Needed:
* Need interface to view all records
* Need interface to view individual record
* Need interface to edit individual record
* Need interface to delete individual record
* Need interface to create new record
---
### Systems:
* Use slim for routing
* Use php templates for rendering
* Use javascript for interactivity
* Add inline code documentation

### Other Requriements
* If you run into errors or problems you are unable to resolve, add a wirte up detailing what is happening, what you think the solution should be, and what your next steps will be.

## Bonus Points:
Bonus points will be awareded for extra creativity in your interfaces.
---
## Submission instructions:
* Create a new branch on the repository for your lab from last week.
* email me the link to your repository as well as the branch name.

---
# Other Notes:
* Feel free to collaborate and bounce ideas / help each other.
* Yesterday you guys moved around and were helping eachother out.  That is good, and actually happens in software development.
  * Not doing group project submission though.  Everyone still needs their own codebase.
