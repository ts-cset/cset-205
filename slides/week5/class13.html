# Agenda
## Data Analysis!
1. What is Data Analysis!
2. Why Analyze Data?
---
# What is Data Analysis
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making
<br/>
<br/>
**In simpler terms:**
<br/>
Data Analysis is the science of examining raw data with the purpose of drawing conclusions about that information.
---
# Why Analyze Data?
* Identify trends over time
* Make predictions and projections
* Make informed decisions
* Support hypothesis
* Facilitate research
* Reduce personal bias when evaluating research / decisions.
---
# Data Analysis Lifecycle
**7 steps to the data analysis**
* Discovery / Requirements
* Collection
* Data Prep / Cleaning
* Exploration / Planning
* Modeling / Algorithms
* Automation / Computation
* Findings / Review / Repeat
---
# Discover / Requirements
This is the planning stage of data analysis.
* What data do we need?
* Who needs it?
* Why is it important?
* What are our goals?
* What is the business value?
---
# Collection
This is our data collection phase.
* Publicly available data sets
* Physical sensors (temperature, traffic cameras, satellites, etc...)
* Interviews
* etc...
---
# Data Prep / Cleaning
This is where we look for and fix any problems with our data set.
* missing data points
* duplicate records
* inaccuracies
* quality of data
* data format checks
  * ensure all money formats are the same Ex: dollars and cents as a decimal ($2000.41) vs. cents as an integer (200041)
---
# Exploration / Planning
This is where we start to look at the data to begin planning out more detailed analysis.
* Look for high level trends in the data
* Identify possible algorithms or modeling to build later
* Identify missing data
* Identify further cleaning / invalid data
---
# Modeling / Algorithms
This is where we bring statistics, math and deeper thought into the mix.
* Mathematical formulas are identified and built to manipulate the data.
* Statistical models are identified and used.
---
# Automation / Computation
This is where we create and or use software to run the formulas and models defined in the previous step.
* Create functions to run against the data
* Generate reports and charts based on the data
* Common programming languages used: Python, R
---
# Findings / Review / Repeat
This is where the decision makers review the output of the models to inform their decisions.
<br/>
May result in additional analysis, new data needed,
<br/>
<br/>
**Rinse and Repeat**
---
# Example:  Weather Data
Lets take a look at a weather data analysis.
Scenario:  Steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is warm for most of the year and with little rainfall each year.
---
# Step 1: Discovery
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.

* What data do we need?

--
  * temperature data
  * rainfall data
--

  * Historical Weather Data
--

* Who needs it?
--

  * Steve, prospective business owner

--
* Why is it important?

--
  * Need to choose the correct location for the new beach resort

--
* What are our goals?

--
  * evaluate weather data to determine what town to build a new beach resort

--
* What is the business value?

--
  * choosing the correct location for a successful business.
---
# Step 2: Collection
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.
* Where to get data?

--
 * National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/

---
# Step 3: Data Prep / Cleaning
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.
Let's look at the data set and see if we have any errors or problems in the data.
---
# Step 4: Exploration / Planning
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.
Let's look at the data set and identify important pieces of data that could be useful.
---
# Step 5: Modeling / Algorithms
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.
Let's identify some algorithms that we can use with the data set.
---
# Step 6: Automation / Computation
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.
Let's build some data processing code.
---
# Step 7: Findings / Review / Repeat
**Scenario:**  steve wants to build a beach resort, but need to find a city where the temperature is not cold and with little rainfall each year.
--
<br/>
<br/>
Problem with this analysis: we have daily average temperatures.  But an average of the high temperature would be better.
<br/>
<br/>
--
**Solution: ** Go download better data and run it again.
---
#Exercise:
Go find other cities and download weather data to try to find a better beach resort city.  We will compare data points and as a class decide the ideal city.
