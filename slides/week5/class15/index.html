## Data Analysis!

## Data Analysis
What is Data Analysis?
<br/>
<br/>
--
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making

* Why?
--

  * Identify trends over time
  * Make predictions and projections
  * Make informed decisions
  * Support hypothesis
  * Facilitate research
  * Reduce personal bias when evaluating research / decisions.
---
## Data Analysis Lifecycle
**7 steps to the data analysis**
--

* Discovery / Requirements
--

* Collection
--

* Data Prep / Cleaning
--

* Exploration / Planning
--

* Modeling / Algorithms
--

* Automation / Computation
--

* Findings / Review / Repeat
---
## Data Analysis Methods
### Qualitative vs Quantitative
**Qualitative Data Analysis**
* Analyzing data that is typically 'Spoken Word' data.
  * Interviews
  * Transcripts
  * Surveys
  * Videos
  * Images
  * Social Media (assuming permission is granted)
* Impressions and interpretation of data by the researchers.
* Key themes,
* Contextual clues
* Contradictions
* lauguage
---
<h2 class="longerheader">Process for analyzing Qualitative Data</h2>
* Read through the data several times.
* Identifying small trends, themes and topics.
* From small trends, identify basic themes.
* Next identify larger, more broad themes.
---
<h2 class="longerheader">Process for analyzing Qualitative Data </h2>
** Survey data of children in developing countries about education**
After reading all of the survey responses, here is a list of small trends discovered.
* No uniform
* No Textbooks
* High School Costs
* No / Low Family income
* Worry
* Distracted
* Tired
* Headaches

### Group those small trends into larger trends.
* Cannot afford to go to school
  * No uniform
  * No Textbooks
  * High School Costs
  * No / Low Family income
* Children are stressed
  * Worry
  * Distracted
  * Tired
  * Headaches
---
<h2 class="longerheader">Process for analyzing Qualitative Data </h2>

** Group these larger trends into an even larger trend**
* Children need help with education.
---
## Quantitative Data Analysis
** Numerical Data**
* This is what you have been looking at with the weather and census data.
<br/>

**Common types of quantitative data**
<br/>
* Units (number of things)
* Prices
* Proportions / Percentages
* Rate of change over time
* Ratios
* Scoring / Rankings
<br/>

Statistical analysis is commonly used to summarize data and graphs can be used to render it to researchers.
---

<h2 class="longerheader">Common quantitative data sources</h2>
* Surveys / Questionaires
  * Multiple choice
  * Ranking questions
* Measurements
* Records of data
* Usage Data
---
## Types of Quantitative Data
** Two main types of data**
<br/>
* Categorical Data
  * gender
  * Yes / No
  * Ratings (Good / Average / Poor)
* Numerical Data
  * counts
  * percentages
  * measurements
---
## Sampling
** The act of choosing who to include in your data**
<br/>
Commonly, your dataset is too big to analyze all of the data.
* Remember the temperature data, or census data from earlier this week

<br/>
Sampling allows you to narrow that down to a good representation of that data without having to analyze the whole thing.
<br/>
<br/>

---
##Types of Sampling
* Random sampling
  * ensure that every response or data point has an equal chance of being chosen.
* Extreme sampling
  * Focus on unusual / extreme responses
* Typical sampling
  * Focus on the average responses
* Snowball Sampling
  * Respondants identify other respondants worth talking to / interviewing.
  * At end, ask "Is there anyone else we should get input from?"
---
## Bias
Bias is when data is skewed by outside influences the data set.
* Sampling Bias is caused when some indiciduals have a greater chance of being chosen for analysis
* Self Selection / Non Response Bias is found with voluntary surveys.
  * Only people that are passionate or worked up will reply to surveys.
  * someone who is neutral or middle ground will probably not respond.
  * As a result, your results will be skewed towards the extremes

---
## Review:
**Qualitative vs Qualitative data**
<br/>
  * What is it?
  * Common Data Sources?
  * How to analyze?
<br/>

**Sampling**
  * What is it?
  * Sampling methods
<br/>

**Bias**
  * What is it?
  * Types of bias

## Update to bar chart exercise
I was not happy with how we were echo-ing data from PHP directly into Javascript.
<br/>

**Problems:**
* slightly hacky
* messy
* muddling server side (PHP) with client side (JS)
<br/>

**Solution:**
* Write a browser cookie in PHP
* Read and parse the cookie in JS.
