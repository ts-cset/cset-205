# Review of Yesterday!
## Data Analysis!

# Data Analysis
What is Data Analysis?
<br/>
<br/>
--
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making

* Why?
--

  * Identify trends over time
  * Make predictions and projections
  * Make informed decisions
  * Support hypothesis
  * Facilitate research
  * Reduce personal bias when evaluating research / decisions.
---
# Data Analysis Lifecycle
**7 steps to the data analysis**
--

* Discovery / Requirements
--

* Collection
--

* Data Prep / Cleaning
--

* Exploration / Planning
--

* Modeling / Algorithms
--

* Automation / Computation
--

* Findings / Review / Repeat
---
# Discover / Requirements
--

This is the planning stage of data analysis.
* What data do we need?
* Who needs it?
* Why is it important?
* What are our goals?
* What is the business value?
---
# Collection
--

This is our data collection phase.
* Publicly available data sets
* Physical sensors (temperature, traffic cameras, satellites, etc...)
* Interviews
* etc...
---
# Data Prep / Cleaning

This is where we look for and fix any problems with our data set.
* missing data points
* duplicate records
* inaccuracies
* quality of data
* data format checks
  * ensure all money formats are the same Ex: dollars and cents as a decimal ($2000.41) vs. cents as an integer (200041)
---
# Exploration / Planning
This is where we start to look at the data to begin planning out more detailed analysis.
* Look for high level trends in the data
* Identify possible algorithms or modeling to build later
* Identify missing data
* Identify further cleaning / invalid data
---
# Modeling / Algorithms
This is where we bring statistics, math and deeper thought into the mix.
* Mathematical formulas are identified and built to manipulate the data.
* Statistical models are identified and used.
---
# Automation / Computation
This is where we create and or use software to run the formulas and models defined in the previous step.
* Create functions to run against the data
* Generate reports and charts based on the data
* Common programming languages used: Python, R
---
# Findings / Review / Repeat
This is where the decision makers review the output of the models to inform their decisions.
<br/>
May result in additional analysis, new data needed,
<br/>
<br/>
**Rinse and Repeat**
---
# Yesterday's Exercise:
Looked at Mr. Steve who wants to open a beach town.

What did we find?
--
<br/>
Piles of scv data!
<br/>
---
# What did we do?
* Processed the data in PHP
* rendered it into an HTML table
* started plugging it into D3 for graphs.
---
# Visualizations:
* We saw a simple visualization yesterday.  (Table rendering).
<br/>
## More advanced rendering is possible.
* d3.js
## What is D3?
* Data Driven Documents
* Creates and manipulates html elements based on data via javascript
* Styled via CSS
* Can manipulate HTML and SVGs

---
# Bar Charts:
* This tutorial was created by the creator of D3.
* Go through each of the three sections, then incorporate our temperature data from yesterday into the graph.
* Exercise: https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bar/
---
# Lab:
Flow through the Data Analysis Lifecycle on this data set:  https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/2017/demo/popest/counties-detail.html
Census data by County (for a given state).

* Flow through the 7 steps of the Data Analysis Lifecycle
* Documenting what you create for each step in a README file for the repository.
* Download the data set for a given state
* Create interesting visualizations based on the data.
* Create a new repository on your GitHub account and sene me the link to your data processing and visualization code.
