## Agenda
1. Recap of last class
2. API Documentation
3. Versioning
---
## Lets Review:
* What is an api and what are some benefits of using one?

--
* What are the three main types of API?

--
* What are the 6 principles of a rest api?

--
* RESTful api urls are focused around what?

---
## Questions, Concerns?
Any questions/comments from previous class?
Speak up!  We have plenty of time each class to answer questions and review material.
---
## API Documentation

A well documented api is a thing of beauty.  A poorly documented api is a developer's worst nightmare.
---
## Example 1: Oracle Netsuite
###(Enterprise Resource Planning tool)
http://www.netsuite.com/portal/developers/resources/suitetalk-documentation.shtml

API Documentation: WSDL File.
https://webservices.netsuite.com/wsdl/v2018_1_0/netsuite.wsdl
* This style of documentation works......... If you know what to look for & have the tools to parse it.
* Not user friendly AT ALL!

---
## Example 2: Twilio
https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice
* Code Examples
* Human readable documentation

---
## Types of Documentation:
* Inline Code Documentation
* API Spec Sheets
* Documentation websites
* Changelogs

---
## Why Write Documentation?
* Can help you stay focused when writing code
* Helps the readability of your code
* Easier to transfer projects to other developers
* Sometimes it is required by the client

<!--- these are just some of the benefits --->
---
## Inline Code Documentation
* Developers can more easily read and understand individual classes, methods, functions... etc
* Can generate html formatted documentation directly from the source code which is easier to keep up to date
* It is much easier to write code comments along the way, rather than trying to go back and add them later

---
## Inline Code Documentation
### Intended User: API Developer
* make life easier for you as a developer.
* clearly defines input, output and a description of the function.
* This is good for coming back to a piece of code in the future and troubleshooting.
* Also good for code review in a team setting.
---
## Javadoc
Javadoc was created by Sun Microsystems for the Java language
* It's fairly easy to read and write
* Many IDE's and text editors will recognize the syntax and help autocomplete/color code
* Can be used to generate documentation by scanning the code base
```java
/**
 * Validates a chess move.
 *
 * <p>Use {@link #doMove(int theFromFile, int theFromRank, int theToFile, int theToRank)} to move a piece.
 *
 * @param theFromFile file from which a piece is being moved
 * @param theFromRank rank from which a piece is being moved
 * @param theToFile   file to which a piece is being moved
 * @param theToRank   rank to which a piece is being moved
 * @return            true if the move is valid, otherwise false
 * @since             1.0
 */
boolean isValidMove(int theFromFile, int theFromRank, int theToFile, int theToRank) {
    // ...body
}
```
---
## Example: PHP
```PHP
/**
  * Gets the identified user record
  * [GET] /users/{slug}
  * @param string $slug Slug of user to get
  *
  * @return object Returns the user object.
  **/
  public function getUserAction($slug)
   {
       $user = getUser($slug);
       return json_encode($user)
   }
```
---
## Example: JSDoc
* JSDoc http://usejsdoc.org/
* Similar to Javadoc or phpDocumentor
* Extensions are available for several editors / IDEs
* Can be installed globally or as a project dev dependency
---
## Installing JSDoc
Install Globally with NPM
```bash
npm install -g jsdoc
```
## Generate Documentation
Each time you want to create or update the html documentation, run the executable
```bash
jsdoc src -r -c ./jsdoc.json -d docs
open ./docs/index.html
```
---
## Common JSDoc Tags
* The @param tag provides the name, type, and description of a function parameter.
* The @returns tag documents the value that a function returns.
* The @since tag indicates that a class, method, or other symbol was added in a specific version.
* The @inheritdoc tag indicates that a symbol should inherit its documentation from its parent class.
* The @async tag indicates that a function is asynchronous.
<!---
 In this example it would be good to note that the order of the tags doesn't matter
 however it makes logical sense to others to read them in this order.
--->
```javascript
/**
 * Returns the sum of a and b
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @returns {number}
 * @since 1.0.1
 */
function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
---
## Exercise: Lets Add Documentation!
documentation-demo in the labs
---
## API Spec Sheets
### Intended User: API Developer/Designer
This is a technical document that details all endpoints, responses, parameters and examples of an api.
Used when planning and building an API.

Contains info about the following:
* endpoints
* allowed http actions
* fields
* response objects
* content types
* YAML, JSON etc...
---
## Story Time!
### Built an API with the folloiwng strtucture / requirements:
* 35+ endpoints
* we create api spec
* customer built it
* we use it in web application
---
## Story Time!
* It looked something like this:
.center[![Center-aligned image](realapispec.png)]
---
## Swagger
Tool for building API Specs:  https://editor.swagger.io/#

.center[![Center-aligned image](swagger.png)]
---
## Exercise: Lets Add Documentation!
Create a spec sheet for the api.

Back to the cars api!
---
## Swagger JSDoc
* Allows inline code documentation for a REST API
* Parses swagger syntax from JSDoc tags
* Creates a OpenAPI (Swagger) specification file
### Install Globally with NPM
```bash
npm install swagger-jsdoc -g
```
---
## Create/Edit swaggerDef.js in the project root
```javascript
module.exports = {
  info: {
    // API information (required)
    title: 'Hello World', // Title (required)
    version: '1.0.0', // Version (required)
    description: 'A sample API', // Description (optional)
  },
  host: `http://localhost:8080`, // Host (optional)
  basePath: '/', // Base path (optional)
};
```
---
## Generate Swagger File
```bash
swagger-jsdoc -d swaggerDef.js ./src/**.js
```
### Visit https://editor.swagger.io/ and copy/pasta or import your swagger.json file
---
## Documentation Websites
### Intended User: customers, prospective customers, developers, users etc...
A good documentation site will drive developers to your api, but a bad one will actively drive them away.
Parts of a good API Documentatio site:
* quickstart guide
* endpoint list
* endpoint documentation with examples
* authentication guide
* sample code
* error handling/troubleshooting guide
* tutorials
---
## Example Documentation Site:

Twilio: Phone Service API Provider
https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api
* Overview: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms
* Endpoint Overview: https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message
* Tutorial: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/tutorials/how-to-set-up-your-php-development-environment
* Troubleshooting: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/troubleshooting/debugging-your-application
* Auth/Setup: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api

RESTCountries
* https://restcountries.eu
This is a markdown file converted into HTML via a generator tool.
* Flatdoc http://ricostacruz.com/flatdoc/
---

## Documentation.js
* Uses JSDoc formatting so either tool can be used on the same project
* Since it uses JSDoc all the editor plugins are compatible
* Can be installed globally or as a project dev dependency

### Install Globally with NPM
```bash
npm install -g documentation
```

### Generate Documentation
Each time you want to create or update the html documentation, run the executable
```bash
documentation build src/** -f html -o docs
open ./docs/index.html
```
---
## Documentation.js
It can also serve, and live-update HTML docs
```bash
documentation.js serve --watch src/** -f html
```
---
## Changelogs / Release Notes
A record of changes and updates made to the system.  Usually published when a new release/version of the project is made public.

### Example Release Notes:
Version 1.0.10 Release Notes:
A new endpoint for "packages" was created.
__Breaking Changes:__ The field "delivery attempted" was removed from the "deliveries" endpoint.

Real Example: https://www.twilio.com/docs/voice/voip-sdk/ios/changelog

---
## Changes to the API
* Things change
* New features are added
* Bugs are found & fixed
* Deprecate old code

How do we indicate this to someone consuming our API?

---
## Semantic Versioning!
https://semver.org/

Semantic versioning is an intuitave way of indicating the nature of patches released to the system.

Major.Minor.Patch
Ex: v1.8.9
* Major Version 1
* Minor Version 8
* Patch 10
---
## Version Types
Ex: v1.8.9
* Patch
  * Bugfix (backwards compatible)
* Minor Version
  * New Feature (backwards compatible)
* Major Version
  * Any change not backwards compatible
---
## Version Numbers
Ex: v1.8.9
* Major version 0 is pre-release, development/alpha/beta testing.
* Each increment increases in increments of 1.
* When a bug is fixed that maintains backwards compatibility, increase patch number.
* When a new feature is added that maintains backwards compatibility, increase the minor version number
* When any changes break backwards compatibility, increment the major version number.
* When incrementing a version number, reset any versions "smaller" (to the right) to 0.


__Note:__ These are not decimals.  it is possible to have numbers > 10

1.10.42 is a valid version number.

## Indicating Version in REST
Several ways to include version information in a REST api.
* URL route
* URL query parameter
* Request Headers
---
## Via URL (most common)
Major version number added to the url.

https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/

### Pros:

* straightforward
* easy to see what version is being used
* simple to build.

### Cons:

* breaking changes cause who new urls to be needed.
* minor, patch versions not indicated.
* potentially need several instances of the api to be 'live'
---
## Via Query Parameter
Major version added as query parameter
http://api.example.com/literature/books?version=1

### Pros:

* easy to default if not provided

### Cons:

* complicated routing.
* each endpoint needs to care about version and perform different logic accordingly
* minor, patch versions not indicated

---
## Custom Request Headers
Full version added as custom http request header
```Bash
curl -H “version: 1.0.1”
http://api.example.com/literature/books
```
### Pros:
* Most specific
* includes minor and patch versions

### Cons:
* more complicated on API side
* more complicated on Client side
---
## Technical vs Marketing
###Technical Versioning !== Product/Marketing Versioning

Two types of versioning.
1. Technical versioning (semantic versioning)
2. Product versioning (marketing)


Ex: Windows NT
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT#Releases
