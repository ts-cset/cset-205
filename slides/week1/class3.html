# Agenda
1. Recap of last class
2. Virtualbox
3. Vagrant
4. PHP!
---
# Lets Review:
* Types of Documentation
* Documentation generators
* Semantic Versioning
* API Versioning

---
# Development Environments
* Dev environment ideally matches production environment
* Need a way to run ubuntu on your laptops.
* Don't want to uninstall your existing operating system.
---
# Virtualbox!
Virtualbox is a free virtualization tool that allows you to run a virtual computer inside your computer.
* Benefits of virtual machines:  Can have multiple versions of dependencies without running into conflicts.
  * different versions of mysql
  * different versions of php
  * different versions of apache
  * different version of ___

* https://www.virtualbox.org/
* Download and run the installer.
---
# Now what?
We need a server!
Everyone go download and configure a server to run in virtualbox.
--

## wait, that could cause a problem.
--

* I download Ubuntu.

--

* someone else downloads Red Hat

--

* someone else downloads a different version of Ubuntu...

--

* Everyone's server could be slightly different.

---
# Now what?

~~Everyone go download and configure a server to run in virtualbox.~~

We need a way to programatically configure a server for us so that we all have the same server.

---
# Enter Vagrant!

Vagrant is a server management toolset.

* It allows us to all run identical virtual servers.
* cuts down on "It works for me" issues.

---
# Exercise:
My First Vagrant Server!
https://www.vagrantup.com/intro/getting-started/index.html
---
# Why are we doing this?
* gain exposure to industry standard tools
* prep for the next major part of the class.
  * creating our own APIs!

---
# New Programming Language! PHP!

* PHP is a server side language
* 83% of all websites are built with PHP!  https://w3techs.com/
* Guarantee that a good portion of the sites you use are built with PHP.

## Frameworks in PHP
* Wordpress
* Drupal
* Laravel
* Symfony
* Cake
* Zend
---
# What is PHP?
* web programming language created in 1994!
* Backend language that is executed on the server.
* Powers most of the internet.
* Can be mixed into HTML.
* Current Version: 7
---
# How Does it work?
```PHP
<?php
// Some code to be executed
echo "Hello, world!";
?>
```
* each line must end with a ;

--

Can be mixed with HTML, to create 'dynamic' html.
```PHP
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>A Simple PHP File</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1><?php echo "Hello, world!"; ?></h1>
</body>
</html>
```
---
# Variables
```PHP
$variable = 'value';
$array = ['value1', $variable, 'value2'];
$array[0]; // will evaluate to 'value1'
```
* variable names must ALWAYS be prepended with $
* variable names must start with either a letter, or an underscore
* names can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores

## Constnts
```PHP
define("SITE_URL", "https://www.example.com/");
echo(SITE_URL)
```
* variable that cannot change.
---
# Useful Functions
Echo
```PHP
echo('this is a string');
echo('<h1>I can print HTML too!</h1>');
---
# Data Types
* Integer
* Strings
* Floating Point Numbers (Doubles)
* Boolean
* Arrays
* Objects
* Null
* Resources

---
# Integer
* whole numbers
```PHP
$num = 42;

```

---

# Strings
* Text characters
```PHP
$str = 'I am a string';

```

---

# Floats (Decimal)
* Decimal values
```PHP
$float = 42.5;

```

---

# Boolean
* True/False
```PHP
$bool = true;
$bool2 = false;
```

---
# Arrays
* lists of data
```PHP
$colors = array("Red", "Green", "Blue");
$colors2 = ["Red", "Green", "Blue"];
$colors3 = array(
    "Red" => "#ff0000",
    "Green" => "#00ff00",
    "Blue" => "#0000ff"
);
```

---
# Objects
* This is a class
* contains fields (data)
* contains functions for interracting with the fields.

```PHP
// Class definition
class cat{
    // properties
    public $str = "Meow!";

    // methods
    function show_greeting(){
        return $this->str;
    }
}

// Create object from class
$message = new cat;
var_dump($message);
```

---

# Null
* This is the PHP 'empty' variable value

---

# Resource
* This is used to reference outside dependencies or objects.
  * file handler
  * email handler
  * etc...
