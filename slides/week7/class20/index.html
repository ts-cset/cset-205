## Python Language
* IEEE Ranked Python as #1 language in 2018
  * https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages
* Supports TDD (Test Driven Development)
* Pre-built and third party modules.
* Easy to learn
* Object Oriented
* Frameworks to build applications
---
## Python3
* Python3 is the current version of python.
* many people still use Python2 despite being end-of-lifed
* common reasons for still using Python2:
  * stubbornness
  * legacy code
  * package availability (less of a problem as python 3 has aged)
---
## Packages!
* Packages are managed via pip
* pip is the Python package manager.
* Example Packages:
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * flask
  * sqlalchemy
  * scipy
---
## Dependencies!
Python is a world of dependencies, and that can cause Problems.
<br/><br/>
Enter Virtual Environments.
* Virtual Environments is a "sandbox" where you can install packages to that specific directory, rather than to the global python instance.
---
## Data Analysis with Python!
* Matplotlib: graphing (similar to d3)
* numpy: python math
<br/><br/>
These two libraries allow you to do most of wht you were doing in PHP / JS!
---
## Exercise Time:
1. install python 3.7 from python's website
2. ```Bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```
3. ```Bash
python3 -m pip install -U matplotlib
```
4. https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-pyplot-py
