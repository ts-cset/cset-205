# Agenda

1. Review of Yesterday
2. Review Lab
3. Error Handling
4. Introduce Project

---
## Yesterday!

* Unit Testing
* Lab
---
## Pros / Cons
### Benefits of unit testing

* know that your code works
* know that changes do or do not affect unrelated pieces of code
* code review can quickly verify that your code works.
* outline of what the code should do and how it should behave.

### Disadvantages/drawbacks of unit testig
* time investment
* individual unit tests do not guarantee that the app works as a whole
* need to test for all possible edge cases / scenarios.
---
## Yesterday's Lab
### Review the code files
* Namespaces
* Autoloading Magic
* Testing
* Testing Put Request

---

## Error Handling:
* Our api is perfect, errors will never happen...

--
* ok, maybe we need some error handling.

---
## Error Handling:
* error response codes should be thrown when errors happen.
* don't always return 200 response.
  * unless you are Facebook. (they always return 200, with error details in the body...)
* 404, 500, etc...

```PHP
$app->get('/people/{id}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
    $id = $args['id'];
    $this->logger->addInfo("GET /people/".$id);
    $person = $this->db->query('SELECT * from people where id='.$id)->fetch();

    if($person){
      $response =  $response->withJson($person);
    } else {
      $errorData = array('status' => 404, 'message' => 'not found');
      $response = $response->withJson($errorData, 404);
    }
    return $response;
});
```
---
## Error Handling Tests:
* Need to test these new cases.

```PHP
public function testGetPersonFailed() {
  $query = $this->createMock('mockQuery');
  $query->method('fetch')->willReturn(false);
  $this->db->method('query')->willReturn($query);
  $env = Environment::mock([
      'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET',
      'REQUEST_URI'    => '/people/1',
      ]);
  $req = Request::createFromEnvironment($env);
  $this->app->getContainer()['request'] = $req;

  // actually run the request through the app.
  $response = $this->app->run(true);
  // assert expected status code and body
  $this->assertSame(404, $response->getStatusCode());
  $this->assertSame('{"status":404,"message":"not found"}', (string)$response->getBody());
}
```

## Lab/Assignment
Create your own Slim API.
* For this repository as a starting point and vagrant configuration:  https://github.com/JimFeather/api-lab-template
## Requirements:
* Database with at least one type of data
* Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) endpoints (20 points)
* Unit Tests for endpoints (20 points)
* Error handling where needed (5 points)
* Inline documentation for routes / functions (5 points)

## Bonus Points:
Bonus points will be awarded if you create your API with more than one data type and endpoint set.
---
## Submission instructions:
* Create a git repository on your github account and send me the link via email.
* Attach a database export / snapshot to your email.
