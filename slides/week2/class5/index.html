* SLIM
---
## Yesterday's Lab
Endpoints From Class:
```PHP
$app->get('/hello/{name}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
    $name = $args['name'];
    $this->logger->addInfo('get request to /hello/'.$name);
    $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name");

    return $response;
});

$app->get('/people', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $this->logger->addInfo("GET /people");
    $people = $this->db->query('SELECT * from people')->fetchAll();
    $jsonResponse = $response->withJson($people);

    return $jsonResponse;
});
```
---
## Endpoints from Lab Assignment:

Get Person by Id
```PHP
$app->get('/people/{id}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
    $id = $args['id'];
    $this->logger->addInfo("GET /people/".$id);
    $person = $this->db->query('SELECT * from people where id='.$id)->fetch();
    $jsonResponse = $response->withJson($person);

    return $jsonResponse;
});
```

* Test it:

```Bash
curl http://192.168.33.10/firstSlim/people/7
```
---
## Update Person by Id
```PHP
$app->put('/people/{id}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
    $id = $args['id'];
    $this->logger->addInfo("PUT /people/".$id);

    // build query string
    $updateString = "UPDATE people SET ";
    $fields = $request->getParsedBody();
    $keysArray = array_keys($fields);
    $last_key = end($keysArray);
    foreach($fields as $field => $value) {
      $updateString = $updateString . "$field = '$value'";
      if ($field != $last_key) {
        // conditionally add a comma to avoid sql syntax problems
        $updateString = $updateString . ", ";
      }
    }
    $updateString = $updateString . " WHERE id = $id;";

    // execute query
    $this->db->exec($updateString);
    // return updated record
    $person = $this->db->query('SELECT * from people where id='.$id)->fetch();
    $jsonResponse = $response->withJson($person);

    return $jsonResponse;
});
```
---
## Test it:

```Bash
curl -X PUT \
  http://192.168.33.10/firstSlim/people/7 \
  -H 'Cache-Control: no-cache' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  -H 'Postman-Token: a23837f2-2b01-4776-89a8-8b528bd94aec' \
  -d 'name=Douglas%20Adams&age=49&occupation=author'
```
---
## Delete Person by Id:
```PHP
$app->delete('/people/{id}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
  $id = $args['id'];
  $this->logger->addInfo("DELETE /people/".$id);
  $person = $this->db->exec('DELETE FROM people where id='.$id);
  $jsonResponse = $response->withJson($person);

  return;
});
```

* Test it:

```Bash
curl -X DELETE  http://192.168.33.10/firstSlim/people/6
```
---
## Speaking of testing things...
--
Unit Testing!
* What is unit testing?

--

  * programatic tests of individual pieces of code.
--

* Why should I test?

--
  * automated confirmation that code is functioning
  * allows you to make a change, run the tests and see if something broke
  * code review / pull requests:  allows coworksers to quickly verify that the code works
  * you can build out tests so that you always check the same conditions.
---
## Advantages of unit testing:
* find problems faster
  * If there is a bug in your code, having tests will make that bug more obvious
  * Missing or missed pieces of functionality
* quickly verify that new code or changes does not break existing functionality
* A kind of documentation.  By looking at the tests and the expected output you can figure out how a piece of code is supposed to behave
* Set a definite end goal for the code.
  * If you write tests before the actual code, then you know that you are 'done' writing code when the tests pass.
---
## Disadvantage of unit testing
* each possible outcome needs a test (potential for a lot of code)
* need to spend time to think through your functions before they are built
* time consuming
* test pieces separately does not ensure that the whole system will work.
* poor test data
---
## Example with 2 unit tests:
* Unit test 1: assert that I can open a door with my hand
* Unit test 2: Assert that I can engage a bolt lock with my hand

---

## Missing Test:

* Engaging the lock prevents me from opening the door.
---
## Test Driven Development
* Write tests first
* Write code to satisfy the tests
* know when code is finished,
* forces you to think through your code before you write it.
* it is not uncommon to spend as much time writing tests as actual code, if not more.
---
## Testing in PHP
* PHPUnit.
* PHPUnit is a unit testing framework for PHP applications.
Words to know:
* Unit: smallest portion of code that makes sense to test.
* Mock: stub/recreation of a piece of code for the purposes of testing

---
## Lets build some tests for our Slim People API
* Changes to the vagrant box.
  * updated to php version 7.1 to fix dependency issues.

```Bash
vagrant provision
delete vendor directory
vagrant ssh
cd /var/www/public/firstSlim
composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit
```
---
## Problems with index.php

--

* app creation and app run is in the same file.
* This does not give us a place to hook in and access the code from our tests.
* No easy way to mock the database.

--

### Solution: Lets split index.php into a few files.

* app.php: bulk of the code.
* index.php: database configuration and app->run()
* will use composer.json and autoload to pull app.php into index.php for execution
---
## Solution
* rename index.php => index-old.php
* create new index.php

```PHP
<?php

require './vendor/autoload.php';
$db = function ($c) {
    $db = $c['settings']['db'];
    $pdo = new PDO('mysql:host=' . $db['host'] . ';dbname=' . $db['dbname'],
        $db['user'], $db['pass']);
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_DEFAULT_FETCH_MODE, PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    return $pdo;
};

$app = (new feather\firstSlim\App($db))->get();

$app->run();

```
---
## Solution cont.
* create directory 'src' in firstSlim.
* create app.php in new src directory
---
## Solution cont.
```PHP
<?php
namespace feather\firstSlim;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
require './vendor/autoload.php';

class App
{

   private $app;
   public function __construct($db) {

     $config['db']['host']   = 'localhost';
     $config['db']['user']   = 'root';
     $config['db']['pass']   = 'root';
     $config['db']['dbname'] = 'apidb';

     $app = new \Slim\App(['settings' => $config]);

     $container = $app->getContainer();
     $container['db'] = $db;

     ... logger setup from index-old.php ...
     ... routing functions from index-old.php ...

     $this->app = $app;
   }

   public function get()
   {
       return $this->app;
   }
 }

```
---
## Autoload:

composer.json should be updated to look like this.

```Javascript
{
    "require": {
        "slim/slim": "^3.10",
        "monolog/monolog": "^1.23"
    },
    "require-dev": {
        "phpunit/phpunit": "^7.3"
    },
    "autoload": {
        "psr-4": {
            "feather\\firstSlim\\" : "src"
        }
    }
}

```
Execute:
```Bash
composer dump-autoload
```
---
## Confirm it works
* visit http://192.168.33.10/firstSlim/people
* If it looks like it did yesterday then everything works. :)

---
## Lets finally do some testing!
* Create directory 'tests' in firstSlim.
* Create file 'apiTest.php'

```PHP
<?php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class TodoTest extends TestCase
{
    public function testTodoGet() {
        $this->assertTrue(true);
    }
}
```
---
## You now have a test file!
```Bash
phpunit tests/apitest.php
```
* this will execute your tests.
* should pass, we are just asserting that true is true.
---
## Some more useful tests!
```PHP
public function testHelloName() {
  $env = Environment::mock([
      'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET',
      'REQUEST_URI'    => '/hello/Joe',
      ]);
  $req = Request::createFromEnvironment($env);
  $this->app->getContainer()['request'] = $req;
  $response = $this->app->run(true);
  $this->assertSame($response->getStatusCode(), 200);
  $this->assertSame((string)$response->getBody(), "Hello, Joe");
}
```
---
## Test Get People
```PHP

// test the GET people endpoint
public function testGetPeople() {

  // expected result string
  $resultString = '[{"id":"1","name":"Steve Martin","age":"73","occupation":"comedian"},{"id":"2","name":"Johnny Depp","age":"55","occupation":"actor"},{"id":"3","name":"Sammy Hagar","age":"70","occupation":"musician"},{"id":"4","name":"Elvis Presley","age":"42","occupation":"musician"},{"id":"5","name":"Joe Johnson","age":"25","occupation":"driver"},{"id":"7","name":"Samuel L Jackson","age":"69","occupation":"actor"},{"id":"8","name":"Steve Wozniak","age":"68","occupation":"programmer"},{"id":"9","name":"Ada Lovelace","age":"36","occupation":"programmer"},{"id":"10","name":"Grace Hopper","age":"85","occupation":"programmer"},{"id":"11","name":"Alan Turing","age":"41","occupation":"programmer"}]';

  // mock the query class & fetchAll functions
  $query = $this->createMock('mockQuery');
  $query->method('fetchAll')
    ->willReturn(json_decode($resultString, true)
  );
   $this->db->method('query')
         ->willReturn($query);

  // mock the request environment.  (part of slim)
  $env = Environment::mock([
      'REQUEST_METHOD' => 'GET',
      'REQUEST_URI'    => '/people',
      ]);
  $req = Request::createFromEnvironment($env);
  $this->app->getContainer()['request'] = $req;

  // actually run the request through the app.
  $response = $this->app->run(true);
  // assert expected status code and body
  $this->assertSame($response->getStatusCode(), 200);
  $this->assertSame((string)$response->getBody(), $resultString);
}

```

## Exercise:
* Build tests around the other endpoints.
