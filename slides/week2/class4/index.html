# Agenda

1. Review of last week
2. PHP Exercise
3. Introduction to Slim (PHP Framework)

---
## Last Week in Review

---
## APIs
* What is an API?

--

* What are they used for?

--

* Three Types of APIs:

--

  * Operating System
  * Remote / Web APIs
  * Libraries / Frameworks

--

* CURL, what is it?
---
## RESTful APIs
* 6 principles of a RESTful API?

--

  * client-server
  * stateless
  * cacheable
  * uniform interface
  * layered
  * code on demand

--

* REST URL Structure

--

  * collection focused.
  * use HTTP request type to determine interaction
  * https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/Germany

--

* Strategies for Authentication
--

  * Basic Auth
  * API Keys
  * OAuth

---
## Documentation
* 4 Types of documentation

--
## Documentation

  * Inline Code Documentation
  * API Spec Sheets
  * Public documentatino websites
  * changelogs

---
## Semantic Versioning
* Version Numbers

--

  * Major
  * Minor
  * patch
---
## Virtualbox / Vagrant
* Benefits of server / dev environment management?
* vagrant command to create server?
* vagrant command to shut down/delete server?
* vagrant command to ssh into server?
---
## PHP
* powers most of the internet.
* programming language
---
## New Business
---

Exercise:  https://www.learn-php.org/
---
## Tracking Errors in PHP / Apache
* Sometime errors will be displayed to the browser.
* Errors also written to the Apache Error Log.
```Bash
sudo su
tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log
```
* PHP error logs
```Bash
tail -f /var/log/apache2/access.log
```
* access logs (shows traffic)
---
## Composer
.center[![Center-aligned image](https://getcomposer.org/img/logo-composer-transparent.png)]

* This is the NPM of the PHP world.
* PHP package manager.
---
## Benefits of composer:
* manage dependencies
* version lock dependencies
* autoloader automatically brings dependencies and custom scripts into your application
* ease of updating dependenceis
---
## Using Composer:
* More JSON Files!
composer.json
```Javascript
{
      "require": {
          "slim/slim" : "^3.0"
      }
}
```
* add this file to git, that way anyone who checks out the repo will get same dependencies downloaded
* ensures uniform versions of dependencies
* dependencies are downloaded to a /vendor directory
* gitignore the /vendor directory, otherwise all dependencies will be stored in your repo.
---
## Slim
* PHP framework for building apis and web applications.

---
## Lets start a Slim project.
From your labs/virtualMachines directory:

--

Checkout the class4 branch
```Bash
git fetch
git checkout class4
```

SSH into the vagrant machine
```Bash
vagrant ssh
```

---
## Directory Setup
* Change directory to your working code directory
  * This is configured as a shared directory with your Mac.  It matches the virtualMachines directory.

```Bash
cd /var/www/public
```

* make a new directory.

```Bash
mkdir firstSlim
```

---
## Install Slim via Composer.

```Bash
composer require slim/slim
composer install
```
* This uses composer to fetch slim and it's dependencies and places them in a newly created 'vendor' directory
* This directory is automatically created via composer install, so it should be excluded from git via gitignore.
* created 'composer.json' and 'composer.lock' files
---
## Code time!

* create index.php in firstSlim directory

---
## index.php
Lets build the php code from scratch!
---
## Empty PHP file
```PHP
<?php
```
---
## Bring in dependencies
```PHP
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;
```
* This pulls in dependenceis that are provided via slim's composer install process.
* located in 'vendor/psr/http-message/src'
* This allows us to use the Request and Response objects in our code.
---
## autoload
```PHP
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require './vendor/autoload.php';
```
* autoload.php is part of composer.
* It allows you to automatically pull in scripts and classes without having to manually import them.
---
## Create slim application

```PHP
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require './vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new \Slim\App;
```
* $app is our instance of slim.
---
## Create a request handler
```PHP
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require './vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new \Slim\App;
$app->get('/hello/{name}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
    $name = $args['name'];
    $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name");
    return $response;
});
```
* {name} in the url indicates what the argument will be called.
* $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name"); adds the text "Hello, $name" to the response.
---
## Finish out the app
```PHP
<?php
use \Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface as Request;
use \Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface as Response;

require './vendor/autoload.php';

$app = new \Slim\App;
$app->get('/hello/{name}', function (Request $request, Response $response, array $args) {
    $name = $args['name'];
    $response->getBody()->write("Hello, $name");
    return $response;
});

$app->run();
```

* $app->run() calls out to slim's run function
* This tells PHP to run the slim app.

---
## Lets see it in action!
Visit the following url with your name instead of 'your name here':
http://192.168.33.10/firstSlim/hello/your_name_here

---
## Questions, confuion?
---
## Lets turn this into an API

--

## Step 1: logging
```Bash
composer require monolog/monolog
```

index.php
```PHP
$container = $app->getContainer();
$container['logger'] = function($c) {
    $logger = new \Monolog\Logger('my_logger');
    $file_handler = new \Monolog\Handler\StreamHandler('../logs/app.log');
    $logger->pushHandler($file_handler);
    return $logger;
};
```
* This creates a new directory 'logs' in the firstSlim directory
* Creates and writes to app.log file in that directory.
---
## Step 2: database
```Bash
cd /var/www/public
mysql -u root -p < apidb.sql
```

Insert after "require './vendor/autoload.php';"
```PHP
$config['db']['host']   = 'localhost';
$config['db']['user']   = 'root';
$config['db']['pass']   = 'root';
$config['db']['dbname'] = 'apidb';
```
Need to pass new config into app creation.

replace

```PHP
$app = new \Slim\App;
```
with
```PHP
$app = new \Slim\App(['settings' => $config]);
```
---
## Step 3: new endpoint!
Get people
```PHP
$app->get('/people', function (Request $request, Response $response) {
    $this->logger->addInfo("GET /people");
    $people = $this->db->query('SELECT * from people')->fetchAll();
    $jsonResponse = $response->withJson($people);

    return $jsonResponse;
});
```
---
## Lets test it!
http://192.168.33.10/firstSlim/people

--

## Lets see it in action!
http://192.168.33.10/slimExampleClient/
---
## Step 4: New endpoints!
Lab: Create remaining endpoints for rest.

* Get person by id
* Edit person by id
* Delete person by id
