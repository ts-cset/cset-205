# Review of Last Week!
### Data Analysis!

## Data Analysis
What is Data Analysis?
<br/>
<br/>
--
Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making
--

  * Identify trends over time
  * Make predictions and projections
  * Make informed decisions
  * Support hypothesis
  * Facilitate research
  * Reduce personal bias when evaluating research / decisions.
---
## Data Analysis Lifecycle
**7 steps to the data analysis**

* Discovery / Requirements
* Collection
* Data Prep / Cleaning
* Exploration / Planning
* Modeling / Algorithms
* Automation / Computation
* Findings / Review / Repeat
---
## Data Analysis Methods
### Qualitative vs Quantitative
---
## Sampling
* Three Types of Sampling

--
  * Random
  * Extreme
  * Typical
  * Snowball
---
## Bias
* Types of Bias

--
  * Sampling
  * Self Selection / Non-Response
---
## In Class Exercise: APIs and Data Analysis.
### Aviation flight records.

* Discovery / Requirements
* Collection
* Data Prep / Cleaning
* Exploration / Planning
* Modeling / Algorithms
* Automation / Computation
* Findings / Review / Repeat
---
## Discovery / Requirements:
* See how many flights went to each destination
---
## Collection
* this is done for you.  (labs/virtualMachines/flightdata)
---
## Data Prep / Cleaning
--

* none to do here.
---
## Exploration / Planning
--

* pie chart for destinations
---
## Modeling / Algorithms
--

* calculate percentages for pie chart
* render on a map
---
## Automation / Computation
* lets look at some code!
---
## Findings / Review
* Looks good!
--

* Lets put it on a map!
---
## Mapping
### https://leafletjs.com/
* Leafletjs: open source mapping library
* MapBox: google maps like service.  Provides maps to be used in building applications
