# Last Week
# Python!
* Intro to Python
* Graphing with Python
* Building APIs with Python
---
## Test Review:
### Data Analysis:
--

Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making
---
## Why Analyze Data?
--

* Identify trends over time
* Make predictions and projections
* Make informed decisions
* Support hypothesis
* Facilitate research
* Reduce personal bias when evaluating research / decisions.

---
## Data Analysis Lifecycle
**7 steps to the data analysis**
* Discovery / Requirements
* Collection
* Data Prep / Cleaning
* Exploration / Planning
* Modeling / Algorithms
* Automation / Computation
* Findings / Review / Repeat
---
## Discover / Requirements
--

This is the planning stage of data analysis.
* What data do we need?
* Who needs it?
* Why is it important?
* What are our goals?
* What is the business value?
---
## Collection
--

This is our data collection phase.
* Publicly available data sets
* Physical sensors (temperature, traffic cameras, satellites, etc...)
* Interviews
* etc...
---
## Data Prep / Cleaning
--

This is where we look for and fix any problems with our data set.
* missing data points
* duplicate records
* inaccuracies
* quality of data
* data format checks
  * ensure all money formats are the same Ex: dollars and cents as a decimal ($2000.41) vs. cents as an integer (200041)
---
## Exploration / Planning
--

This is where we start to look at the data to begin planning out more detailed analysis.
* Look for high level trends in the data
* Identify possible algorithms or modeling to build later
* Identify missing data
* Identify further cleaning / invalid data
---
## Modeling / Algorithms
--

This is where we bring statistics, math and deeper thought into the mix.
* Mathematical formulas are identified and built to manipulate the data.
* Statistical models are identified and used.
---
## Automation / Computation
--

This is where we create and or use software to run the formulas and models defined in the previous step.
* Create functions to run against the data
* Generate reports and charts based on the data
* Common programming languages used: Python, R
---
## Findings / Review / Repeat
--

This is where the decision makers review the output of the models to inform their decisions.
<br/>
May result in additional analysis, new data needed,
<br/>
<br/>
**Rinse and Repeat**
---
## Data Analysys Methods
### Qualitative vs Quantitative
--

* Qualitative:  Spoken word, not numerical/categorical
* Quantitative: numerical / categorical data.
---
<h2 class="longerheader">Identitifying Qualitative Data Trends</h2>

--
* Read through the data several times.
* Identifying small trends, themes and topics.
* From small trends, identify basic themes.
* Next identify larger, more broad themes.
---
<h2 class="longerheader">Identifying Quantitative Data Trends</h2>

--
* numerical / statistical analysis
* graphs and charts
---
## Sampling
--

** The act of choosing what to include in your data**
--

### Types of sampling:
--

* Random sampling
  * ensure that every response or data point has an equal chance of being chosen.
* Extreme sampling
  * Focus on unusual / extreme responses
* Typical sampling
  * Focus on the average responses
* Snowball Sampling
  * Respondants identify other respondants worth talking to / interviewing.
  * At end, ask "Is there anyone else we should get input from?"

---
## Bias
Bias is when data is skewed by outside influences the data set.
--

* Sampling Bias is caused when some indiciduals have a greater chance of being chosen for analysis
* Self Selection / Non Response Bias is found with voluntary surveys.
  * Only people that are passionate or worked up will reply to surveys.
  * someone who is neutral or middle ground will probably not respond.
  * As a result, your results will be skewed towards the extremes
---

## Data Visualization
* D3
  * https://bl.ocks.org/hrecht/f84012ee860cb4da66331f18d588eee3
* Matplotlib
  * https://matplotlib.org/gallery/ticks_and_spines/custom_ticker1.html#sphx-glr-gallery-ticks-and-spines-custom-ticker1-py
<br/><br/>
--

* create different types of visualiations.
* bar, line, pie etc...

---
## Mapping
* Leaflet.js
  * https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/
* GEOJson & Geographical Data
  * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON

---
## Data Analysis Review Exercise:
Project:  I am a stock investor who wants to buy into a new stock.  Evaluate 5 stocks and come up with a few visualizations showing me what stock to pick.

### Requirements:
* Work through the data analysis lifechycle.
* Use alphavantage.co API to get stock data
* Create several charts to show which stock will provide the best return on investment.
  * Render several stocks on the same chart with different colors, and a key indicating which color is which stock.
  * Suggested charts: price history over time, change in price over time, average change per year
* Use either JS & D3 or Python & Matplotlib to generate your charts.
---
## Deliverables
* Details of each of the steps in the data analysys lifecycle
* Recommendation of which stock to invest in.
* Create a web page detailing your recommentation, as well as embed your charts to support your recommendation.
