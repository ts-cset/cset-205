# Agenda

1. Authentication Review
2. Test Review
3. Middleware Exercise
4. Study / Lab time

---
## Wednesday's Lecture: Auth
### Types of Autnencication:
* Basic
* API Key (Oauth2)
---
## Basic Auth:

Send username / password with each request to the API.
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication

---
## Auth Cont.
```PHP
$app->add(new Tuupola\Middleware\HttpBasicAuthentication([
    "users" => [
        "root" => "letMeIn",
        "somebody" => "12345"
    ]
]));
```
---
## Security Error from yesterday
* "Insecure use of middleware"

Found that it was due to using Basic auth over non https.
>>> Basic authentication transmits credentials in clear text. For this reason HTTPS should always be used together with basic authentication. If the middleware detects insecure usage over HTTP it will throw a RuntimeException with the following message: Insecure use of middleware over HTTP denied by configuration.

## OAuth2
* OAuth is a more involved method of authentication.
* OAuth is a process.

1. User registers with API and is provided with a secret (similar to a password)
2. Make request to API with secret to get token
3. Pass your token with each api request.

## Questions / Comments?
---
## Test Review
* What is an API?

--

  * It is a set of functions/methods that developers use to interact with data or systems that are related to, but not necessarily part of your application.

--

* What they are used for:

--

  * Accessing data from a remote data set
  * Performing CRUD operations tasks on a remote data set
  * Abstracting complex calculations away from your application code
  * Interact with hardware

--

* 3 type of api

--

  * Operating Systems
  * Libraries and Frameworks
  * Remote / Web APIs
---
## Test Review
* 6 properties of REST

--

  * Client-server architecture
  * Stateless
  * Cacheable
  * Uniform Interface
  * Layered
  * Code on Demand (optional)

--

* RESTful URL Structure

--

  * Are collection focused, rather than action focused. (Look for the noun)
  * Are consistent across endpoints
  * Make use of request type to determine actions
  * Human readable(ish)
  * GET https://api.example.com/cars/mustang
  * PUT https://api.example.com/cars/mustang
---
## Test Review

### Documentation Types
--

* Inline Code Documentation

--
    * code comments
    * used to generate other documentation
    * intended for developers
--

* API Spec Sheets

--
    * outlines structure of the API
    * intended for developers and API designers
---
## Test Review

### Documentation Types (cont.)

* Documentation websites

--
    * public api documentation
    * intended for customers, developers, users etc...
    * can be generated via inline documentation
--

* Changelogs

--
    * intended for developers
    * details changes and updates made to the codebase
---
## Test Review
* Semantic Versioning

--

  * major version
  * minor version
  * patch number

--

* version in url
  * query parameter
  * in the rul
  * request header
---
## Test Review
* vagrant / virtualbox
* vagrant commands
--

    * vagrant up
    * vagrant halt
    * vagrant ssh
    * vagrant destroy

--

* php
  * wordpress
  * drupal
  * slim
  * \> 80% of the internet is PHP
---
## Test Review
### Unit Testing
* Benefits of testing
--

  * automated confirmation that code is functioning
  * allows you to make a change, run the tests and see if something broke
  * code review / pull requests:  allows coworksers to quickly verify that the code works
  * you can build out tests so that you always check the same conditions.
---
## Test Review
### Unit Testing
* Error Handling
  * gracefully handle errors in the code execution
* parts of an error response
--

  * code
  * message
--

* errors in an api
  * 404 not found
  * 500 system is broken
  * 401/403 not authenticated
---
## Test Review
* Integrating APIs
  * http requests
  * mixed html / php
  * Framework for routing (SLIM)
  * html/JS

---
## Test Review

* look over slides from previous classees and you will be fine.
* look at the exercise code from previous classes.  (firstslim/slimclient)
* Questions, Further explanation needed?
---
## Middleware Exercise:
Yesterday in class we used a pre-built middleware basic authentication system.


Today: Visit this documentation page and create some middleware for yourself.
* https://www.slimframework.com/docs/v3/concepts/middleware.html
* Look at the "Application middleware" and "Route middleware" headings.
* Use the "hello/{name}" endpoint or create a new endpoint to play with.
